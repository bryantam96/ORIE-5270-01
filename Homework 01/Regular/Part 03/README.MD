The result for each user is given as a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the user. The second element is the list of friend recommendations corresponding to the user in the first element. This list is sorted from the recommendation with the highest score to the recommendation with the lowest score. More specifically, the second element is a list of tuples, with the score for each recommendation in the first element of each tuple and the actual friend recommendation in the second element of each tuple.
